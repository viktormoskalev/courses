        Clearance fits
    </h5>
    <div class="card-green-border-description">
Clearance fits provide that any assembly of mating parts will have a margin between the parts. This tolerance is useful for accurately locating parts while still allowing for ease of assembly and disassembly. Clearance fits work with parts that must slide or rotate in relation to each other, such as a rotating shaft in a bushing. The fits can be loose or running fit. Assemblies that don't need precise mating can use loose clearance fits. Running clearance fits allow a thin film of lubrication between the mating parts.

        Interference fits

    </h5>
    <div class="card-green-border-description">
     
        Interference fits will always produce resistance between the two parts in an assembly. This type of fit is common in press-fit dowel pins or fasteners. The stress between the part and the hole improves the joint's life. Joining can be shink-heavy fit, medium fit, or tight-press fits. Shrink interference fit assembly parts need to remain locked together during use by expanding the hole with heat and rapid cooling after joining. Assembly using tight-press interference fits join with hand or light pressure and are semi-permanent. Interference fit gives a small window of tolerance and focuses on the mating pair location placement.

        Transition fits
    </h5>
    <div class="card-green-border-description">
   

        Transition fit works like a mix between clearance and interference fits. It provides a range of acceptable dimensions that work when a slight tolerance is acceptable, but an accurate mating location is necessary. The fit can be pushed, forced, or wringing, depending on how tight the parts need to mate. Pushed transition fits allow parts to move slightly and provide the least joint vibration. In force transition fit, one part cannot move without the other. Wringing transition is the tightest paring and requires force mesh.
