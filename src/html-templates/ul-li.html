        <p>There are three types of fits: <br> <br> 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong> Allowance   </strong>  - The intentional difference in size between mating parts        </li>
          



          <li>  <strong>  Feature  </strong>   A specific portion of a part to which the dimensions apply. Features can include surfaces, edges, slots, radii, threads, and chamfers.             </li>
          <li>  <strong> Basic dimension </strong>     - The exact theoretical size of a feature, which is used to locate a feature or define a true profile. Basic dimensions are enclosed in a box on the drawing: <br>  <div class="box-with-border">1500</div>   <br>      </li>
          <li>   <strong>  Form tolerance </strong>      -The amount of acceptable surface variation from the perfect form, such as a line, plane, or cylinder.         </li>
          <li>  <strong> True position  </strong>  -The perfect or ideal location of a feature such as a point, line, or surface.             </li>
          <li>  <strong> Datum  </strong>   - A geometric figure such as a point, line, plane, or cylinder that’s assumed to be exact for the purpose of a reference.            </li>
          <li>  <strong> Location tolerance  </strong>         - The tolerance applied to the dimension that allows a specific variation from the perfect location of a feature. The tolerance applies to the relationship of the controlled dimension of a feature from the datum.        </li>
          <li>    <strong> Profile of a line  </strong>     - The specified permitted variation from the true form of the line.        </li>
          <li>   <strong> Profile of a surface  </strong>         - The specified permitted variation of a tolerance zone in three dimensions (length, width, and height) or circumference of a feature.     </li>
          <li>   <strong>  Runout  </strong>      - The total variation from a desired circular surface when the part is rotated one full circle around its axis. Runout is often measured with a dial indicator with the part mounted in a rotating fixture (or lathe). If the maximum positive reading of the indicator is +0.001" and the minimum negative reading is –0.002", the total runout would be 0.003".        </li>
          <li>  <strong>  Full indicator movement (FIM) </strong>    - The term used to replace the former notation of total indicated reading (TIR). Note that the abbreviation FIM isn’t used on drawings.            </li>
