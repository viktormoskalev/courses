          <p>Many parts have circular symmetry and multiple features that occur at intervals 
              on a specific radius. Imagine a metal round, a wheel hub, or an extruder. 
              The drafter will use a theoretical circle called the <strong> bolt circle (BC)  </strong>  to draw these features, 
              showing the diameter and angle of separation of each hole. Think of a bolted flange, such as 
              you might find on a fire hydrant or valve body. The holes are symmetrically—equally spaced—at a radius. 
              For example, a drawing notation might read 0.500 DIA – 3 HOLES EQL SP – 2.50 BC (also written as Ø02.5 BC). 
          </p>
          <p>This notation means that there are three 1/2-inch-diameter holes, 
              equally spaced 120 degrees apart. The centers of the holes lay on 
              an imaginary circle 2.5 inches in diameter." <strong> Figure 44  </strong>  shows another example with more holes. 
              You can calculate the angular separation of equally spaced holes by dividing
               the number of holes into the 360 degrees of a complete circle. For example, 
               five equally spaced holes would be 360/5 degrees apart, or 72 degrees. Again, 
               the notation EQL SP can apply to many different types of features, even those in a straight line.

            Holes can also be on a bolt circle yet be unequally spaced, as shown in <strong> Figure 45. </strong> 
             With unequally spaced holes, the drafter may use one of two methods to show feature placements. 
             They might show one hole with a centerline reference and a curved dimensioning 
             line showing the next hole's angular distance. 

          </p>
          <p>They might also show the horizontal and vertical tolerance dimensioning 
            between the centerline of the two features placed on the BC.
             Holes are probably the most common feature placed and dimensioned with a bolt circle, 
             but other features might appear as well
