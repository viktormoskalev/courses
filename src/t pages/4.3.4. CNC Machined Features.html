          The blueprint for a profile insert shown in <strong>  Figure 4  </strong> is an example of a part machined by WEDM. The operations for this part include milling the block to size, drilling the WEDM start hole, heat treating, grinding, and then WEDM machining the profile. The .8636 and 1.0613 dimensions help determine whether the WEDM has machined the profile to finish size or whether the piece needs another pass. If the part is left oversize after the finishing on the WEDM, it will go back to grinding to have the block finish-ground. At that time, the machinist can use the .4367 and .5682 location dimensions and the 2.0000 × 2.0000 block size to determine which side and how much material to grind away.

        <p> 
          The machinist will prepare the stock as shown in the view with the starter hole location and dimension. The part will be milled and drilled, heat-treated, and ground to size. The WEDM operator will then burn the profile out using a CNC program to control the machine's motion. The CNC programmer and machine do the most complex work on this type of part. However, the machinist still has a critical job: to properly prepare the stock by making sure that the sides are flat, square, and to size.

         <strong> Figure 5</strong>  shows the same part as shown in <strong> Figure 4</strong>  with all of the information required to both machine and WEDM the part. This print has information on it that’s useful only by the WEDM programmer or operator. However, a machinist familiar with this type of print can determine which dimensions necessary for machining and shouldn’t be confused by the dimensions required by the WEDM operator. The machinist can use the same size and location dimensions to prepare the block for the WEDM process and finish it after the WEDM operation. A quick check of one or two size dimensions will show if the WEDM process correctly finished the part. Then grinding to the correct size and feature location can happen. The machinist should ignore the profile dimensions used by the WEDM program. Other types of parts that often include CNC program information and basic machining information include cams with mathematically defined

         <strong> Figure 5</strong>  is an example of a part with a complex surface generated by CADD software as a solid model and will be machined using CNC equipment. The tapped holes and stock may be manually machined, and the part finish machined on a CNC mill. Inspectors can use the print to check several dimensions to assure that the part is the proper size. As in the WEDM example in Figure 4, most of the complex geometry dimensions used by the CNC machine programmer don’t appear on this print shown in Figure 5.
