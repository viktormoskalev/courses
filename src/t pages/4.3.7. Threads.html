          To start, the machinist needs to provide the proper starting diameter for the thread. In applications where the thread is to be milled—or turned on a shaft—machine the thread's major diameter before attempting to machine the threads. If the threads are to be internally turned on a lathe or tapped, the proper starting hole must first be machined into the part to provide clearance for the tap or

The major diameter for shafts or external threads will usually be equal to the size called out in the thread designation—.500for a 1⁄2" thread, 10 mm for an M10, and so on. Depending on the class of fit, this diameter may need to be closer to the nominal or ideal size so that the finished thread has the proper fit with the mating part.

          Trying to make a stronger thread requires much higher torque, and it’s more likely that the tap will break during machining. This failure can cause excessive machining time and costs and possibly result in scrapping the part.

          There’s a growing use of a special tapping method called a cold-forming or thread-rolling tap. This tap actually cold-works or rolls the material into place rather than cutting the material. This method of tapping makes a high-quality thread that appears burnished or polished. Since it doesn’t create chips, it’s useful in blind holes, where cleaning out the chips can be a problem. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          Also, this tapping can actually make a stronger thread due to the type of forming done. The machinist's concern is that if using a cold-forming tap, they need a different chart to select the tap drill size. Since the material isn’t cut out of the hole but formed, a larger tap drill is required, and a chart—specifically set up for the cold form tap—gives the proper tap drill.</p>

        <strong>Figure 8 </strong>   includes several tapped holes, along with the thread callouts for the holes. It contains a great deal of information for the machinist. For example, the tap drills' given depth is the depth of the tip of the drill. The blind 1⁄4-28 tap drill appears as a .21 diameter drill × .68" deep. The thread length shows as .50" deep and is the depth of the good thread. The tip of the tap will need to run farther into the hole to provide the full depth of thread required. If the tap's tip runs in only .50" deep, it’s possible that when assembling the part, the bolt won’t be able to



        </p>
        <p> 
          be screwed into the part far enough. This hole depth is something that the machinist will need to make sure is correct before the part is finished, and especially before it’s hardened through heat-treated. Once hardened, it’s much more difficult and expensive to correct tapped holes that are too shallow. If in doubt, run the tap drill deeper, making sure that it doesn’t break out the other side—unless there’s a note allowing this. </p>

         <strong>Figure 8  </strong> shows the 3⁄8-16 UNC tap as thru all. Again, this is the full thread, not just the tip of the tap. Since no actual part dimension exists, ensure that both the tap drill and tap extend completely through the part when tapping this hole. The 10-32 UNF tap has both a dimension showing the tap drill depth of .54" and a note stating that the tap drill can go all the way through the part.

          Adding this note makes the tapping operation easier since it’s always easier to tap a through-hole since the chips can push ahead of the tap. With a blind hole, the chips may pack in the bottom of the hole. If the tap drill can’t go deep enough for the required thread depth, the machinist may need to use a bottoming tap since it has less lead and can tap closer to the bottom of the hole. </p>

          The pipe taps design—a type of tapered taps—allows sealing with a mating part using an interference fit during assembly. For this reason, the tap should only as deep as the specification states. Any further depth will cause the diameter to get larger and may cause the interference fit to leak.
