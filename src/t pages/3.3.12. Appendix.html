  "desc":"There are many other control frame symbols you might see on a blueprint. A tangent plane—shown as a capital T enclosed in a circle—controls the high points of a surface. The concept is similar to parallelism in controlling the flatness of a surface. However, the tangent plane allows for times when the entire surface does not need to be perfectly flat. <br> <br>  The all-around symbol—a bent arrow crossing a circle—shows that listed tolerances apply to the surfaces around a control frame feature. Similarly, all-over—represented by an arrow passing through the concentricity double circle—applies the stated tolerance to all surface elements. The between symbol—shown as a double-ended arrow—applies tolerances to adjacent features. Letters will reference the starting and ending points of the between control. <br> <br>  You can see how these control frame tolerances can build upon one another to provide information to the reader. We have discussed some frequently used symbols, but many more exist",
