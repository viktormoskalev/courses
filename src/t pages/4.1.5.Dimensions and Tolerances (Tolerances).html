This difference between the high and low limits on a dimension is called the tolerance. Another way to think of the overall range of acceptable dimensions can be a tolerance band—as used in electronics. Tolerance can affect the size and location dimensions and geometric features such as flatness, parallelism, and others. As a refresher, in lesson 3.2, we defined unilateral tolerance as having +/- dimension, bilateral tolerance as having single side variations, and limit tolerance using specified high/low limits. Along with these international standards, many companies have internal standards that define how their blueprints portray features, dimensions, tolerances, notes, and symbols in conjunction with national or international standards.

         <strong> Figure 6  </strong>  shows the drawing for a part with holes that will extend through the part. The machinist will drill these features to fall anywhere between the two limiting dimensions. Each hole might have a slightly different size that could still keep it within the shown tolerance allowance. The engineer could have shown the same hole dimension as a bilateral tolerance—0 .375 +/–.005—giving the same nominal size.

        </p>
        <p> 
         <strong> Figure 6  </strong>  also uses a unilateral tolerance for the part's width, allowing only a variation below the nominal width of 3.00 inches. If the machinist cuts the part from a piece of bar stock to a 3" length, it allows .03" to clean up the cut face and still be within tolerance.”

          The image in <strong> Figure 6  </strong> highlights three holes with their location referenced using a bilateral tolerance—+/- 0.005. Notice that while all three features have the same bilateral tolerance, they each have locations based on the distance from another piece's face. Each hole's diameter has the same stated tolerance—Ø 0.370 - 0.380 (3PL) THRU.
<br><br>
          The machinist can read the dimension from the machine's digital readout—vernier scale during production. The tolerance allows for a location variance on both sides of the drilled hole, making it easier to match readings on the machine with dimensions on the print. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          It reduces errors and allows quicker manufacturing by using the entire tolerance on the dimension. 
<br><br>
          If the part had only one stated tolerance, a variation in the wrong direction would create a useless piece. The shown bilateral tolerance has equal positive and negative tolerances. However, both tolerances don’t need to be equal—allowing an uncentered theoretical location. For example, a dimension of 2.50 +0. 010 / –0.005 shows that the engineer wants a 2.50 dimension, but the machinist can place the feature anywhere between 2.510 and 2.495 and still be within tolerance.

        <p>
          When setting up a part with unilateral or bilateral tolerances that aren’t equal, the machinist should usually set up to machine the part to a dimension centered between the two limits. This setting allows the machinist the maximum use of the tolerance and allows the most variation during production while remaining within the required tolerance.
<br><br>
          Sometimes, a machinist will set up to machine a part to its maximum material condition (MMC). 
        </p>
        <p> 
          They might do this when the part is difficult and expensive to produce. Machining to the MCC will allow the most material to remain after tooling. For example, they might drill a hole towards the lower tolerance since they can rework the piece, if necessary, to remove additional material but can't add material back onto the piece. The decision to stay on the MMC-side of tolerance comes after considering factors of cost, time, material availability, and the part's functionality.
