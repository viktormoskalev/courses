  "desc":"Gears are used in many mechanisms to change the rotary motion direction of shafts and increase speed or torque delivered by the shafts. The flat, toothed gear—called a spur gear—is one of the earliest and most common types of gear used in mechanical assemblies. Much of the terminology relating to gears originated with the design of spur gears.  The pinion is normally the gear that drives the gear train by directly connecting to a motor. When the pinion—or drive gear—is smaller than the next gear, shaft speed reduces while the torque increases. When the pinion is larger than the driven gear, speed increases, but torque reduces",

  "desc":"One of the most important design factors for a gear set is the gear ratio. The gear ratio is the numerical ratio of the number of teeth on the pinion to the number of teeth on the driven gear. For example, a pinion with 40 teeth and a driven gear with 120 teeth have a gear ratio of 1:3. This ratio means that the smaller pinion will turn three times for every turn of the larger driven gear, thus reducing the speed by a factor of three."
