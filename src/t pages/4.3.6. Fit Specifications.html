          Companies will often develop standard notations for fits to list both the feature's actual size and its standard notation. An example of this method would be—1.2510 +.0006/–.0000 (LN2—Basic Hole System).

          This example gives the standard for a Light Press Fit (LN) with the Basic Hole System—the hole includes the basic dimension of 1.2500". If using the same fit for the basic shaft system,

          the dimension and tolerance is— 1.2500

          Finally, the designer may simply list the nominal dimension and the fit on the print, such as—1.2500" diameter (LN2—Basic Shaft System). With this notation, the machinist would need to look up the proper allowances for the basic shaft size and apply it to the print dimension.

          The remaining columns specify the maximum tolerance and clearance allowed for by an LC1 fit. For instance, the maximum clearance value is .0009" (.9 × .001). Similarly, the hole diameter can vary from nominal .750 (–0) to .7505 (.750 +.5 × .001), and the shaft can vary in diameter from .750 (+0) to .7496 (.750–.4 × .001).

          The deviation letter defines the tolerance zone's position with respect to the basic dimension—similar to the fits discussed above. The deviation letter will be uppercase for internal dimensions such as holes and lowercase for external dimensions such as shafts. The IT grade is a number from 01 through 16 indicating the tolerance zone's magnitude, with the larger numbers having a larger tolerance zone. Examples of metric fit designations include 35 h9—indicating a shaft with a basic dimension of 35 mm, a deviation

Furthermore, 22 G7 describes a 22 mm diameter hole with a deviation of G and an IT grade of 7, comparable to an ANSI sliding fit (RC2). When the print has no actual dimensions and tolerances, the machinist will need to look up the correct values in a standards chart.
