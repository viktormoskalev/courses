       <strong> Flatness</strong>    is the condition in which all points on the surface of the part are on the same plane. The symbol for flatness looks like an offset rectangle. It defines the feature's flat uniformity called out by imaging two parallel lines on either side of the highlighted feature. Machinists and inspectors might use a height tool to check a part's flatness, but the most useful tool to measure flatness is a coordinate measuring machine that can judge the flatness across the full surface. Flatness is similar to straightness but is measured on two

          planes—making it a 3D measurement.
          An applied flatness tolerance of 0.010" means that all points on the part's surface will be within the boundaries of two parallel planes 0.010" apart, as shown in <strong> Figure 39. </strong>  The top plane will contact the highest element on the surface, the bottom plane will be the specified tolerance below the top plane, and all surface irregularities will be above the bottom plane.

           <strong> Straightness  </strong>  applies a zone of uniform width along the length of the feature, as shown in <strong> Figure 40 </strong>. The straightness symbol looks like a straight line enclosed in the control frame box and can refer to a surface or axis condition. The surface straightness applies to a line on the part’s surface. The axis—or axial—straightness controls the curve of the part, usually a cylinder.

          It will include a maximum material condition measurement and appear next to the axis dimension. The surface of the part may take any shape. However, it must be within the tolerance zone as indicated by the full indicator movement (FIM) of a measuring device such as a dial indicator.

         <strong>  Circularity  </strong>  (roundness) is the condition in which every surface segment is the same distance from the center of a circle. The symbol appears in the control frame box as a circle and controls the roundness of a cylindrical piece such as a bearing, rod, or shaft.

          The tolerance zone is two concentric circles the distance of the tolerance apart, and every point of each segment must be between the two circles. <strong> Figure 41 </strong>  illustrates the meaning of circularity.
