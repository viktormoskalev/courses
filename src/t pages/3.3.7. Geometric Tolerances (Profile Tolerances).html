         <strong> Profile of a line </strong>  defines a feature line on, usually, a curved piece and gives information about the part’s radius. The control frame symbol resembles a parenthesis laid on its side—forming a curved, single rainbow—line. The profile of a line holds that all line elements of a cross-section of the piece must fall within two parallel lines—forming the perfect profile. For example, at any cross-section, the line must lie within the boundaries formed by two parallel lines, .005 apart, as shown in  <strong>Figure 43(A) </strong> . Using the 2D concept on a surface, you could take several cross-section measurements as you move across the entire surface.

        <strong> Profile of a surface   </strong>  broadens the concept of the profile of a line, extending it to all points of a surface as a 3D tolerance. The surface profile symbol resembles a half-circle resting on its bottom line. Here, two planes create tolerance control. Coordinate measuring machines can test the surface for accuracy. You will see profile of a surface frequently on blueprints as it is it suits many parts that can’t be controlled by other tolerances. For example, the surface profile controlled must have all elements within a tolerance zone formed by two parallel planes, .005 apart, as shown in <strong>  Figure 43(B). </strong>
