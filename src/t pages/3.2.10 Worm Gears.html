These gears allow the transfer of power through large speed reduction ratios while also creating high torque multiplication. In combination, the worm can turn the wheel, but not vice versa, allowing them to act as a braking or locking system  ",

The pitch—also called the lead—is the distance that the screw will advance in one revolution. The lead angle, or helix angle, must match the angle cut on the worm wheel's teeth. For this reason, worm gear sets are usually designed and sold as matched sets. ",

This ratio will be the speed reduction factor from input to output as well. With a 1:120 gear ratio, an input shaft speed of 1800 rpm will have an output speed of only 15 rpm (1800÷120=15) —a tremendous speed reduction. Theoretically, the torque could increase by the inverse factor of 120:1. ",

The gear ratio is the numerical ratio of the number of teeth on the pinion to the number of teeth on the driven gear. For example, a pinion with 40 teeth and a driven gear with 120 teeth have a gear ratio of 1:3. This ratio means that the pinion will turn three times for every turn of the driven gear, thus reducing the speed by a factor of three."
