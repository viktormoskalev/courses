      <p>   In this section, weâ€™ll discuss some special cases that appear on both hand-drawn and CADD-generated drawings. These include mirrored parts (left-hand and right-hand configurations), tables of part dimensions (family of parts on one drawing), CNC part prints (prints with some of the forms generated by a program rather than manually), surface finishes on a part, and tool mark symbols. Some of these procedures and
        print notes are applied to tell the machinist how to best machine the part, or to reduce paperwork. Others are done for the convenience of the drafter. Again, as more prints are CADD generated, it becomes easier to provide specific prints for each configuration.
