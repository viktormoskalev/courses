          Feature control frames apply geometric tolerances to specific features on a part without adding too many notes to a drawing. 
          <strong> Figure 36 </strong>  shows how the feature control frame uses symbols to describe the feature's tolerances. The first part of the frame shows the geometric symbol applied to the feature; the second part of the frame contains the tolerance,

          Some control frames are relatively simple, using only a geometric symbol and a tolerance, while others have additional information to guide print interpretation. Two or more feature control frames can be combined to apply more than one type of geometric tolerance to a feature, as shown in <strong> Figure 37.</strong>  Combined—or composite—control frames can define another datum when a feature must have a defined
