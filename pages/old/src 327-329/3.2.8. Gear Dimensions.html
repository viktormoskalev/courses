One of the important characteristics of a gear set is the <b>diametral pitch</b>—the number of teeth per inch of the gear's <b> pitch diameter.</b>  <br> <br>  For example, a gear with a diametral pitch of 12 will have 12 teeth for every inch of pitch diameter. If the gear has a pitch diameter of 2 inches, the gear will have a total of 24 teeth (2 × 12 =24) around the outside. A 3-inch gear with the same diametral pitch will have 36 teeth (3 × 12 =36). <br> <br> This simple explanation has two practical implications. A gear can have only a whole number of teeth around the outside, and all gears with the same diametral pitch will have the same size tooth and, therefore, mesh properly with any other gear of the same diametral pitch.",

          In designing gear teeth, the shape of the tooth must have precise dimensions and curvature to make sure it meshes properly with other gear teeth—called an <b> involute curve.  </b>  This curve is the shape you would trace with a pencil tied to a piece of string as it unwinds from the surface of a cylinder. The specific form is necessary, so the teeth make contact at the same distance from the center of each gear at every point during the rotation—from the first contact

         of each tooth until it disengages. Since the surfaces are curved, as a pair of gears turn, the two gear teeth will always contact an angle—called the <b>  pressure angle</b> , as shown in <b>Figure 21</b>. Standard gear forms use either a 20° or 14 1/4° contact angle, with the 20-degree angle being more popular in modern manufacturing designs.

          The gear width determines how much horsepower it can transmit since its full tooth width transmits the gear's force.

          Helical gears—with teeth cut at an angle to the face—are similar to spur gears. An example appears in <b> Figure 26.</b>  Helical gears can provide higher torque, last longer, and run quieter and smoother at high speeds. A common application is in a transmission. Some uncommon, special application helical gears have shafts cut that aren’t parallel.
