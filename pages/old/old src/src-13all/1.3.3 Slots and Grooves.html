Slots are elongated holes usually having straight sides and ending with a rounded radius on the ends. Most often, flat plates will have slots cut into them. Slots and slides mate and securely hold two specifically shaped pieces together while still allowing movement within specified tolerances. Grooves usually run along the edge of a plate, cylinder,  or surface. They can take many shapes, including bevel, tee, and Y-shaped.

          Architectural applications use slots with metal and wood cabinets, metal studs, and floor-joist trusses. Steel beams are sometimes slotted to allow easier assembly. Slots are commonly shown in cross-section to show their internal details, leaving the length to be dimensioned and shown in another view. 
         <b> Figure 48 </b>  shows some examples of slots and grooves drawn in cross-section.

        <p> <b> Figure 49  </b> shows an annular groove, another common type of groove machined on the inside of a tube or the outside of a shaft. They’re common for machines that use snap rings to locate gears or pulleys. Groove dimensioning specifies the width (W) and depth (DP)—or the width and diameter—as shown in <b> Figure 49. </b>
