          The <b> primary datum plane  </b>  is the initial starting point for all subsequent measurements on the part. It’s established by three points of contact, which can be identified by datum target symbols on a drawing. High school geometry teaches us that two points define a line, and three points define a plane. Three points can be chosen from the real part and used to define

          Using a perfect datum plane perpendicular to the primary datum plane, you can establish a <b> secondary datum plane.  </b> <br>

          The third—tertiary—data plane is then perpendicular to both the primary and secondary planes. <b>Figure 33   </b> shows the relationship between the three datum planes, usually labeled A, B, and C in drawings. Identifying the primary, secondary, and other datums are important for both machining and inspection since the variability of features can

          If a part is machined using one surface as a datum and then inspected using another as the primary datum, it might cause the rejection of a good part or acceptance of a bad part. 
          <b> Figure 34</b>—with exaggeration of features—shows how this could occur on a part without datums specified. If you read prints as part of a machining or inspection job, make sure you know how to interpret the datums and features in relation to each other.
