          Drawings will have objects portrayed in one or more views that show critical details of the object. This “object” can be a mechanical part such as a gear; a building floor plan; or a representation of a physical arrangement of components such as air conditioners or electrical wiring. The various orthographic projections show
        
        </p>
        <p> 
          plan views and elevations with enough detail 
          that the print user can use the information 
          provided to do specific tasks. Auxiliary views, sections, and enlargements give important details about the part or object at larger scales, so they don’t get lost in the complexity of other information.

          Notes are often included to give the reader general information that applies to the entire part, such as material notes or units. They’re also used to give specific information that may not be readily apparent form the drawing views. These notes guide the print user in the manufacture or construction of the object.

          Finally, dimensions and tolerances are included so the print can be used to manufacture the part, build the building, or assemble the product. Drawings are usually done at scales larger or smaller than full scale (the part is the same size as the lines on the drawing) to show information for specific purposes: an overall view of the project such as a hotel floor plan or perhaps the fine details of a keyway machined at the end of a shaft.
