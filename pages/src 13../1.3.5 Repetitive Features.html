The drafter draws precise details—such as gear teeth—and uses phantom lines to fill in where the rest of the features would be. <b>  Figure 52</b>  shows an example of a gear with only a few teeth drawn and the rest shown with phantom lines. This shorthand method means that the drawn feature repeats on the rest of the part. If using a CAD tool, there is a pattern feature that can automate repetitive features. <br> <br> Phantom lines are thin dark dashed lines consisting of one long dash and two short dashes. They can also show the alternative position of a feature or material that will be machined away.",

          Another type of repetitive feature occurs when the same feature, such as a hole, is repeated at other places on the part. For example, a plate with four 0.150-inch holes would simply use  
        </p>
        <p> 
          a leader arrow and the notation 4 × Ø.150 to specify all of the holes on the plate, rather than dimensioning each one, as shown in <b> Figure 53  </b>
