        <h5>    FIGURE 6</h5>
        <p class="mb-0">The N-scale represents the International Standards Organization (ISO) system that uses whole numbers—1 through 11—to correspond to the 1–1000 microinch scale and the micrometer scale. The international standard measures surface roughness in a unitless manner. You might see roughness abbreviated as Rt in plans.</p>
