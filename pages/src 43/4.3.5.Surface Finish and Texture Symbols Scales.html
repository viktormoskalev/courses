A finish that’s too rough can cause excessive friction and wear on parts designed to move easily. By contrast, creating a polished finish on a part that doesn’t require it just adds to the time and cost of making the part.

Although this topic can be complex, this section will help break out a few basic symbols and values. The basic surface finish or roughness symbol looks like a checkmark placed on the surface face that it controls. The symbol includes numbers for roughness height, waviness height and spacing, roughness width cutoff, lay symbol, roughness spacing, machining allowance, and symbols for required machining, no machining, and all-around machining.

          The table lists the standard finish values in microinches, micrometers, and N-scale and some applications and methods of producing the finish. Several methods will yield a given finish, so the machinist must decide which one to use to produce the desired quality with the least expense. For instance, a finish of 32 microinches is possible on the mill. However, this finish is near the limit of the capability of many milling operations, but it’s well within limits for grinding. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          The machinist may mill the part roughly to size and then finish by grinding to get both the dimensional tolerance and the finish required. Another consideration is the heat treat specification. If the part needs heat treating after milling and needs to be finish-ground, it makes no sense to spend the extra time milling the part to a good finish, only to grind this finish away in the final operation.

Some of the notes indicate that the surface must be machined, regardless of the raw stock's surface finish. Other notes indicate that the surface shouldn’t be machined and that the given surface finish is an inspection tool. The surface finish symbol can also include directions on how a part should be machined by specifying the direction—the lay—of the tooling marks.

          Finally, the surface finish symbol can include a value for the amount of material left on before finishing a particular surface. As we discussed earlier, the amount of material allowance may also be listed in a note or might be left up to the machinist to decide.

However, the geometric tolerances and surface finish symbols require the machinist to set up and machine it in a particular order.

        <p> Machine datum A face, taking off only enough material to clean up the surface, making sure there’s 	sufficient material left on to clean up the opposite side when bringing the 1.500" dimension into 	tolerance.</p>
