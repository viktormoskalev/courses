When applying runout tolerances to a surface, they apply regardless of whether the parts' dimensions are on a high or low side of the dimensional tolerance limits. In other words, the diameters of both features could be within tolerance, and yet the runout could be outside of the specified geometric tolerance.",

        <p> 
          It applies to a single line (location) on a circular surface perpendicular to the surface. You would use circular runout when the part's function isn’t critical with respect to its rotational speed as measured by the full indicator movement of a measuring device
