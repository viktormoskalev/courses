The shafts of bevel gears mesh the teeth—usually at 90-degree angles—but can have other angle arrangements. The gear tooth angle and arrangement further categorize bevel gears as straight, spiral, and hypoid. The advantage of bevel gears is that they can change the direction of the power transmitted through the shafts.  <b> Figure 27 </b> shows an example of a bevel gear set. As you can see, the input and output shafts aren’t parallel, as they are in spur gears. The design of bevel gears can align the shafts to intersect at any angle. However, it is most common to use a 90° intersection angle. <b>Figure 28  </b> shows a bevel gear in cross-section with many features that you will see dimensioned on prints.",

          Automotive applications often use bevel gears to change the direction of power between the engine and the rear wheels. The smaller drive gear is again called the pinion, and the larger driven gear is called the ring gear or the crown gear.

       <b>   Hypoid bevel gears  </b>      have teeth pitched on a hyperbolic—pinched cylinder—surface. While spur gears have shafts in the same plane (axis), bevel gears allow the shafts to be on different planes. The different axis allows the pinion's contact surface to be larger and provide more torque. Rear-wheel-drive vehicles frequently use hypoid bevel gears.

The gear ratio is the numerical ratio of the number of teeth on the pinion to the number of teeth on the driven gear—or the ring gear in a bevel gear. For example, a pinion with 40 teeth and a driven gear with 120 teeth have a gear ratio of 1:3. This ratio means that the pinion will turn three times for every turn of the driven gear, thus reducing the speed by a factor of three."
