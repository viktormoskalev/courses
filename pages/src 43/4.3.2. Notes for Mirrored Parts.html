A note gave the machinist the information on how to machine both parts without the need for a second print. While this was a frequent practice, it was easy to make mistakes and produce the wrong part. Mistakes were easy when filling orders for replacement parts, was only one of the configurations was required. ",

          With the arrival of CADD software, it became quick and easy to produce a second drawing of most parts showing the opposite-hand configuration. Each configuration has its drawing and part number, meaning there’s

          The image below is a drawing of the righthand part noted in Figure 1. Having a separate drawing for each part, rather than just a note, reduces the chances of misinterpreting the print.
